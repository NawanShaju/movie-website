# movie-website

This website connects a custom-built frontend with a publicly available backend API. The site focuses on movie discovery, allowing users to search for movies, like or unlike them, and view their liked movies on a dedicated "Favorites" page.
The frontend is developed using Vite and React.js, seamlessly integrating with the publicly available Api of "the movie.db".
